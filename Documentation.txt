INTRODUCTION:
This Project, centered around General Purpose Input/Output technology, is an innovative initiative designed to tackle critical local and global challenges. Through the versatile capabilities of GPIO, we are exploring novel solutions that address a diverse range of issues. Join us on this transformative journey as we harness the power of GPIO to drive innovation and make a significant impact on our world.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The primary issue this project seeks to resolve is the frequent occurrence of road accidents caused by drivers using high-beam headlights while driving at night, posing a significant safety hazard on the roads.

SOLUTION:
The proposed solution involves the development of a motion and photo detector system designed to automatically dim the high-beam headlights when two vehicles approach each other, thus enhancing road safety and reducing the risk of accidents during nighttime encounters.
