INTRODUCTION:
This project is centered around GPIO(General Purpose Input Output), its an innovative initiative designed to tackle critical “Road accidents”.
Through the versatile capabilities of GPIO, we have deployed a solution that addresses this issue or challenge.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The primary issue this project seeks to resolve is the frequent occurrence of road accidents caused by drivers using high-beam headlights while driving at night, posing a significant safety hazard on the roads.

SOLUTION:
The proposed solution involves the development of a motion and photo detector system designed to automatically dim the high-beam headlights when two vehicles approach each other, thus enhancing road safety and reducing the risk of accidents during nighttime encounters.

TECHNOLOGY USED:
1. Python
2. Rasberry pie
3. Vs code
4. GPIO 
5. Ultra sonic sensor
6. RGB LED
7. Photocell Sensor
